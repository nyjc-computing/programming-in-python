    "Notice also that direct iteration can be implemented using indexed iteration, and indexed iteration can be implemented with a conditional loop, but not the other way round.\n",
    "\n",
    "This may sound like an invitation to use `while` loops for everything; why would we ever need to use a `for` loop, if `while` loops can implement them?\n",
    "\n",
    "The simple reason is that `while` loops have **great expressive power**; we can express a wide range of intentions with them, *including infinite loops* (e.g. when we are running a game loop that takes user input and carries out the effect of the user's command continuously). So it is very easy to make mistakes with a `while` loop, e.g. ending up in an infinite loop that we did not intend.\n",
    "\n",
    "`for` loops have **limited expressive power**; the range of intentions a `for` loop can express is more limited, e.g. it is practically impossible to write an infinite loop using `for`. This makes them safer to use, and *more clearly expresses our intent*: if you see an indexed `for` loop, you can be sure the author intends to iterate through a sequence of indexes, not end up in an infinite loop. Likewise, if you see a direct `for` loop, you can be sure the author intends to iterate through a sequence of items, without getting confused by their use of indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A further implication of this is that, if code is written by a competent author, we can be sure that when they are using a `while` loop, it is because they need that level of expressive power; what they are doing is not merely fixed iteration, but something that requires conditional checking.\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as possible, we aim to use programming features at the right level of expressive power. This reduces the chance of making mistakes, and communicates our intent more clearly."
