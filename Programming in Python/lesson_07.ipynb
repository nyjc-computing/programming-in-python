    "### Using the Python debugger, `pdb`\n",
    "\n",
    "For Python versions 3.6 and earlier, and in Jupyter Notebook, insert the following expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "    import pdb; pdb.set_trace()\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called a breakpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python 3.7 and later, you can use the `breakpoint()` built-in function call to do the same thing without the need to import the `pdb` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you hit the breakpoint, you will see a `(Pdb)` prompt. If you didn’t hit a breakpoint, it means that line was never reached/executed. While the breakpoint is active, you can use commands to step through the code or inspect the value of variables and objects that are in scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "While inside pdb, any errors that are thrown are displayed, but these errors will not cause the program to terminate. This makes debugging less frustrating.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Invoking pdb conditionally\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a 1000-iteration loop with a mysterious error that only occurs on the 534th iteration, it would be too tedious to step through the debugger until an error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to only invoke the breakpoint when a certain condition is met is to put the breakpoint expression within an if statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Invoking breakpoint on the nth iteration\n",

    "\n",
    "Sometimes a particular line of code in a loop does not always cause an error, and it is not clear why the error occurs. We can wrap the line in a `try-except` statement (covered in later lessons) to invoke a breakpoint:\n",

    "### `pdb` commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time, while in `(Pdb)`, you can type expressions to be evaluated. Usually we will do this to inspect objects. But `(Pdb)` also takes commands. In the following summarised list, you can use either the command or its shortcut:\n",

    "|   quit   |    q     | Quit the debugger and abort the program. |\n",
    "| restart  |          | Restart the Python program. |\n",
    "|          |    p     | Print the evaluated value of the expression after `p`. |\n",
    "|   step   |    s     | Execute the current line; if any functions/methods are called, pause on the first line inside them. |\n",
    "|   next   |    n     | Continue execution (without stepping into functions/methods) and pause at the next line. |\n",
    "|  return  |    r     | Continue execution until the current function/method returns. |\n",
    "| continue |    c     | Continue execution until the next breakpoint is encountered, or the program ends. |\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this means you will not be able to check the value of variables if those variables have the same name as the above commands or shortcuts. You will need to prepend a `p` in front of them to tell pdb to print them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Debugging with pdb\n",
    "\n",
    "So what happens when you get thrown into the debugger? You apply the same skills you used in reading error messages: inspect the available variables, verify that they match your assumptions. You can also run short code snippets in the debugger to test them.\n"
