    "Up to this point, if we need to print complex output strings, we either join the strings using the `+` operator (a.k.a. **string concatenation**), or rely on the `print()` function to do it for us. For example, in Assignment 2, we printed the result in scientific E notation like so:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "print('This number in E notation is', e_notation + '.')\n",
    "```\n",

    "Python has a much more powerful way for us to embed values from variables into strings. This method is known as **formatted string literals**, or **f-strings**  in short. To use f-strings, we put an `f` before the string quotes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f'This number in E notation is _____.'\n",
    "```\n",

    "```python\n",
    "f'This number in E notation is e_notation.'\n",
    "```\n",
