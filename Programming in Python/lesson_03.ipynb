    "The above code demonstrates abstraction, separating the details of validation from those of prompting the user and checking the input. We can see that `prompt_valid_phone_number()` operates at a higher abstraction level than `validate()`, and know that errors in validation likely come from the latter rather than the former.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also demonstrates a couple of common programming patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-line code for readability\n",
    "\n",
    "On lines 12-16, we broke up the `elif` conditional expression into multiple lines, making it easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over decades, Python programmers have codified these readability rules into a document, called PEP8. You can read the recommendations for multi-line indentation at https://pep8.org/#indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that readability is not required for your code to run. However, programming is not only an act of instruction to the computer, it is also an act of communication with other programmers who may be interacting or using your code, or even reading it for learning and understanding. Taking care to write readable code demonstrates consideration and respect for the community of programmers, whom you also rely on when you use code they have written.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithmic patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Lines 6-19 could have been written as:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if userinput:    \n",
    "    if userinput.isdecimal():\n",
    "        if len(userinput) == 8:\n",
    "            if (\n",
    "                    userinput.startswith(\"6\")\n",
    "                    or userinput.startswith(\"8\")\n",
    "                    or userinput.startswith(\"9\")\n",
    "            ):\n",
    "                return \"ok\"\n",
    "            else:\n",
    "                return \"Phone number must begin with 6, 8, or 9\"\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            return \"Phone number consists of 8 digits\"        \n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return \"Type digits only\"\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    return \"Nothing was typed\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While this style of coding may have a certain aesthetic appeal, it is harder to read, and also trickier to debug: in the outer layers, trying to visually match up the returned message at the bottom with the respective condition at the top is error-prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pattern of writing flat `if-elif-else` statements demonstrates an **algorithmic pattern** which I term \"negative validation\". Algorithmic patterns are coding patterns that programmers, over a sufficiently long period of time, settled on as \"best practices\" or elegant ways to solve certain kinds of problems in a maintainable and easy-to-understand fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "The only thing missing now is re-prompting the user to input a valid phone number if the validation fails. This involves *repeating* the code, a different computational feature called **iteration** which we will cover in the next two lessons."
